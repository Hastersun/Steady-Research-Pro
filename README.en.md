# Steady Research Pro — Deep Fix Report

[English](README.en.md) | [简体中文](README.md)

## Overview

Steady Research Pro is an intelligent research assistant UI built with Astro + Tailwind CSS + Ollama. It provides deep research and analysis capabilities with a clean, responsive interface.

## What’s Fixed

### ✅ Issues Resolved

1. TypeScript typing errors
   - Fixed `currentStep` type inference in `ResearchAgentUI.astro`
   - Resolved "Property 'start/finish/addLine' does not exist on type 'never'" errors
   - Fixed all TypeScript issues in `OllamaPanel.astro`
   - Added proper type assertions and null checks

2. Tailwind CSS configuration warning
   - Removed deprecated `@tailwindcss/line-clamp` plugin
   - Tailwind CSS v3.3+ includes line-clamp natively

3. Component event conflicts
   - Fixed duplicate listeners on the same button in `ResearchAgentUI` and `SidePanel`
   - Refactored to a custom-event based communication mechanism
   - `SidePanel` owns research logic; `ResearchAgentUI` focuses on UI animations

4. Module import issues
   - Removed dependency on a non-existent `/src/lib/ollama-api.js` import path
   - Simplified `OllamaPanel` implementation to use the Fetch API directly

5. Code structure improvements
   - Cleaned up redundant code blocks
   - Optimized script execution order
   - Clearer separation of concerns across components
   - Better error handling and edge-case checks

### ⚠️ Notes

1. API routes
   - API routes only support POST; sending GET will log a warning (expected)
   - All API endpoints (`/api/ollama`, `/api/research`, etc.) require POST

2. Ollama dependency
   - The project depends on a local Ollama service at http://127.0.0.1:11434
   - Ensure Ollama is running to access full functionality

## Features

- ✅ Intelligent research plan generation
- ✅ Multi-source search and aggregation
- ✅ Real-time progress tracking and visualization
- ✅ Chain-of-thought style trace display
- ✅ Ollama model integration
- ✅ Responsive design (mobile-friendly)
- ✅ Streamed data handling
